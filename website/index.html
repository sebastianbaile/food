  <p>I likes because it is always good if you do it right, and because you can flavor it anyway you want to like
    chicken, you can make it spicy or sour etc. You can flavor it how you like.
    <h1>Next is grilled burgers</h1>

    <p>I like burgers because its something that everyone can make their own way that they like and you can make it
      different ways which is always good because if they want they can their choice of sauce and items that they want
      in it, </p>
    <p>and if you are the one doing the cooking the food on bbq, all you need to do is cook the meat </p>
    <h1>next is chicken</h1>

    <p>Chicken is one of my favourite foo to put on a bbq because its something a lot of people like because you can
      make different sauces or marinades, different batter to cook it with, and with the batter you can different
      spices, salt and pepper to change the flavor of make it better and. Its the same with the sauce or marinades, you
      can make your own sauce of marinade or you could make someone else's recipe from a friend or from the enternet.
